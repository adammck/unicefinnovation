		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p>
			Combining low-tech hardware with sophisticated open-source software,
			we explore novel ways to both empower young people and improve UNICEF's
			operations.  We seek to connect youth who have access to information on
			the Internet to those who do not, through innovations in technology and
			program initiatives that are educational and inclusive. We also find ways
			to integrate appropriate technological systems into existing UNICEF working
			practices to augment and improve the effectiveness of our operations
		</p>
		<p>
			We collaborate with others to make this happen, convening development
			professionals, academia, and the private sector.

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>In early 2007, Dr. Sharad Sapra, UNICEF’s Director of the Division of Communication posed a series of questions to UNICEF staff about how the rapid technological change the world is experiencing can benefit UNICEF's mission and work.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>&quot;How to connect youth who are connected to those who are not?&quot;</li>
			<li>&quot;How can the explosion of mobile phone users and networks change they way development work is done?&quot;</li>
			<li>&quot;How can UNICEF use the power of ever growing social networks of youth to educate, inform and empower?&quot;</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A group of interested people, starting in UNICEF’s Division of Communication, but expanding to other areas within and outside UNICEF started thinking about what this would mean for children around the world and began exploring different ways to address this challenge.</p>

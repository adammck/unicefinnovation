		<h2>The Issue</h2>
		<p>One of the biggest challenges facing UNICEF's field operations is access to accurate and timely information. With the recent proliferation of technology throughout the developing world, the ability to improve this access has become cheaper and the tools to do so, ubiquitous.  Mobile phones have spread the fastest and farthest of all these technologies with the GSMA predicting that by 2010, 90% of the world will be covered by mobile networks.  RapidSMS capitalizes on this change by integrating the instantaneous information transfer that mobile phones allow into established methods of UNICEF's work.</p>
		
		<h2>Action</h2>
		<p>RapidSMS is a suite of different products all created from the same underlying pieces of computer code. Each one was crafted to solve a specific problem of a field office. The underlying code-base is open-source, so anyone can use it to build their own tools, and designed to be customized for the varied needs and constraints of UNICEF and the developing world.</p>
		<p>Each RapidSMS product is an SMS-based tool that enables mass-scale mobile data collection and messaging. Users can collect both quantitative and qualitative data through customizable SMS forms adapted to the demands of each situation or project.  Quantitative data from the forms can be edited through a RapidSMS web interface, exported to Excel, and displayed with a built-in graphing tool. Qualitative data can be collected in open-ended questions known as 'general queries.' General queries can be used to poll a base of users or community on a certain question or topic, and all responses are stored in an SMS inbox for easy review.</p>
		<p>With the RapidSMS web interface, multiple users from around the world (with proper log-in credentials) can simultaneously access the system to view incoming data as it arrives, export new data-sets, and send text messages to users. Being "open-source" software RapidSMS is free to download, use, and modify -- and runs well even on low-powered and older computers, needing only a GSM modem and SIM card to get started. RapidSMS leverages popular programming languages, and thus is easily integrated into existing ICT systems.</p>
		<p>A RapidSMS implementation has optional audio capabilities so users can leave voice messages or browse information through an IVR interface that can recite text or play audio clips over the phone. This currently requires a computer with PBX hardware installed and a land line or voice-over-IP line; however UNICEF Innovations is currently working to develop a solution that uses a standard cellphone (connected to the computer) to receive phone calls and record messages into the system.</p>
		
		<h2>Impact</h2>
		<p>The impact a RapidSMS implementation has on UNICEF's work practices is dramatic.  In October 2008, Ethiopia experienced crippling droughts.  Faced with the possibility of famine, UNICEF Ethiopia launched a massive food distribution program to supply the high-protein food Plumpy'nut to under-nourished children at more than 1,800 feeding centres in the country. Previously, UNICEF monitored the distribution of food by sending a small set of individuals who traveled to each feeding center.  The monitor wrote down the amount of food that was received, was distributed, and if more food was needed.  There had been a two week to two month delay between the collection of that data and analysis, prolonging action.  In a famine situation each day can mean the difference between recovery, starvation, or even death. </p>
		<p>The Ethiopian implementation of RapidSMS completely eliminated the delay.  After a short training session the monitors would enter information directly into their mobile phones as SMS messages.  This data would instantaneously appear on the server and immediately be visualized into graphs showing potential distribution problem and displayed on a map clearly showing where the problems were. The data could be seen, not only by the field office, but by the regional office, supply division and even headquarters, greatly improving response coordination.  The process of entering the data into phones was also easier and more cost effective for the monitors themselves leading to quick adoption of the technology. </p>
		<p>Without accurate and timely data, it is very difficult to make decisions, see where there are problems, respond quickly, and allocate resources effectively. RapidSMS is a powerful suite of tools that directly address this problem improving coordination and impact.</p>

				<h4>Short Message Service (SMS)</h4>
				<p>is a communications protocol allowing the interchange of short text messages between mobile telephone services. The SMS technology has facilitated the development and growth of text messaging. The connection between the phenomenon of text messaging and the underlying technology is so great that in parts of the world the term "SMS" is used as a synonym for a text message or the act of sending a text message, even when a different protocol is being used.</p>

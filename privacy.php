		<h2 class="first">Privacy</h2>
		<p>Your privacy on the Internet is of utmost importance to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).  This privacy statement describes UNICEF’s policy concerning the gathering and sharing of visitors’ information through the UNICEF Innovation web site.  It applies to any “UNICEF Innovation sites” – that is, all sites within the “unicefinnovation.org” domain name.  You should note that through this site you may reach or be directed to other sites that relate to UNICEF, such as http://www.supportunicef.org/  or the sites of our national committees (the various private charities around the world whose job is to support UNICEF); all these sites have their own privacy statements which are similar to this one but may vary slightly.  By visiting the UNICEF Innovation website you are accepting the practices described in this policy.

		<h2>What information does UNICEF collect?</h2>
		
		<h3>Normal Website Usage</h3>
		<p>In general, you can browse the UNICEF Innovation site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.  The only information we gather during general browsing is from standard server logs.  These include your IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, browser type, operating system, and information such as the web site that referred you to us, the files you downloaded, the pages you visit, and the dates/times of those visits.</p>

		<h3>Collection of personally identifiable information</h3>
		<p>If you fill out a form or email us requesting more information you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name, and e-mail address.  This information is collected only with your knowledge and permission, and is kept in various UNICEF databases.  </p>
		<p>UNICEF sites with specific requirements to collect personal information may publish a privacy policy specific for that site.  In these cases, the site-specific policies will be complementary to this general UNICEF privacy policy, but will give additional details for that particular use.</p>
		<p>For certain UNICEF sites, registering or supplying personal information sets a cookie.*  By setting this cookie, UNICEF will remember your details the next time you visit, so you don’t have to re-enter the information.  This helps us to provide you with a better service.</p>
		<p>Joining electronic discussion groups may mean that other participants of the discussion group (including non-UNICEF employees) will see personal information that you have volunteered.  For open discussion groups, this information will be public.</p>
		
		<h3>Special note about information from children</h3>
		<p>Several sites in the UNICEF domain are focused on children, including interactive sites such as group discussions.  Some of these require user-specific information to be provided to UNICEF.  We ask for the minimum amount of personal information in this case.  </p>
		<p>These parts of the UNICEF site are for children and authorized adults only and unauthorized adults are not to participate in these parts of the UNICEF site.  (Obtaining user information helps us in that regard if needed.)</p>
		<p>Children should make sure their parents, or the adults who are caring for them, know they are participating in the UNICEF sites and are providing this limited user information.   </p>
